Splunk Stuff

splunk-app-sfdc.tgz is a copy of the app available on Splunkbase.  I noticed the app contains quite a few searches that are no longer supported in Splunk 7.2 and 7.3 which was causing dashboards to stop working.  This version of the app has those searches fixed to support the current Splunk implementation of SimpleXML.
